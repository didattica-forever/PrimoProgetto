# Welcome

It's time to start your first personal project! This is a big step, up until this point, you've had extremely granular instructions to follow in the courses, and even fairly structured steps to tackle in the guided projects.

It's time to take the training wheels off and build something on your own.


## The Goal of This Project

Your goal here is not to build something that makes money, or even to build something that will make its way onto your resume.

The goal with this first project is simply to get you used to the process of building something from scratch. We want you to get some practice breaking down a project into smaller pieces.


## Requirements

    Try to spend 20-40 hours on this project.
    Use a programming language you're already familiar with.
    Commit your code to Git often, and push it up to GitHub.
    Create a README.md file for your project. It should explain to readers:
        What the project is, and what it does.
        How to clone and run it.
    It's okay (even encouraged!) to use third-party libraries! That said, make sure that some of the code that you wrote is doing something interesting. You don't want a razor-thin wrapper around a third-party library to be the only thing you've written.

## Choose an Idea

The whole point of a personal project is that it's personal. The idea needs to be yours. It's time to fly closer to the sun and break out of tutorial hell, even if the project you build is simple for now, at least it's yours.

## Build something that you find interesting.

This probably isn't a project that will make its way onto your portfolio or resume, but it's still good to get into the habit of building things that are interesting and useful. Interesting and useful projects have many benefits:

    They're more fun to work on
    They have more interesting and difficult problems to solve
    You (or someone else) might actually use them
    They're more likely to grab the attention of other people
    Attention from other people can lead to career opportunities

## How Do I Choose an Idea?

Use a programming language that you're already at least somewhat familiar with. Assuming you haven't been writing a ton of code outside of Boot.dev, your project should probably be a Python program that runs on the command line. That's fine!

I want to provide a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing, but please don't choose a project from this list without at least putting your own spin on it

    A text-based adventure game in the terminal
    A CLI tool to detect the strength of a password, or to validate it
    Tic-Tac-Toe in a tkinter GUI
    A tool that creates ASCII art from an image
    A command line tool to view Reddit feeds in the terminal
    A command line tool that parses a CSV file of pokemon data and lets you search for pokemon by name, type, etc.

## But I Don't Know How to Build X!!!

Your job as a developer is to constantly build stuff that you've never built before. Don't shy away from an idea because you're not sure where to start. Google it. Ask ChatGPT. Ask the Boot.dev Discord community. You might need to put in an hour of research before starting to decide if your idea is feasible within a 40-hour time frame, but that's fine!

Assume that you'll be doing something you've never done before! You have some fundamentals under your belt. Now it's time to piece it all together and research as you go.

## Getting Help

You're going to get stuck. If you don't get stuck, you probably chose an idea that's way too easy.

The trick is developing a skillset for getting unstuck. This is a skill that will serve you well (and is absolutely necessary) in your career as a developer.

### Get Used to Googling

Start with Google. Do some research on your idea. See what others have done when building similar projects. See if there are any libraries you can install to make your life easier.

### Use ChatGPT

Talking through your issues with ChatGPT (rubber duck debugging) can be a great way to get unstuck.

Don't have ChatGPT write your code for you! You won't learn that way, and you'll be dreadfully slow if you get stuck in that habit. Instead, use ChatGPT to help you think through your problems, and ask it to try to find bugs in your code or explain code snippets you don't understand.

Keep in mind that ChatGPT can be confidently wrong, so don't take its word as law. Use it to get back on track, but verify the information it feeds you with other sources.

### Use Discord

Ask questions in the Boot.dev Discord server! As with all question-asking, provide as much context as you can so that when your fellow students and mentors help they can efficiently provide you with the information you need.
